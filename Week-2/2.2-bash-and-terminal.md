# Week 2 - Advanced Bash and Terminal Commands

This document covers the basics and some advanced concepts of using the terminal for various operations. The terminal provides an alternative interface to perform tasks on your machine.

## Navigation and File Management

### `pwd`
- Prints the current working directory.

### `cd` (Change Directory)
- `cd dir_name` or `cd /path/to/directory` to navigate into a folder.
- `cd ..` to go one folder back.
- `cd ~` to go to the user's home directory.

### `ls` (List)
- `ls` to list files and directories in the current directory.
- `ls dirName` to list files in a specified directory.
- `ls -l` for detailed listings including permissions, size, and modification date.
- `ls -R` to list all subdirectories recursively.
- `ls -t` to list files sorted by modification time.
- `ls -la` to list all files, including hidden ones.
- `ls -Rla` for a recursive list of all files.
- `ls -s` to list by size.
- `ls -lR | grep .json` for searching files with a specific pattern.
- `ls ..` to list files in the parent directory.

### `mkdir` (Make Directory)
- `mkdir test` to create a new directory named `test`.
- `mkdir -p path/to/directory` to create a directory and all necessary parent directories.

### `touch`
- `touch filename` to create a new, empty file.

### `cat` (Concatenate)
- `cat file` to display the content of a file.
- `cat > file` to write to a file (overwrite).
- `cat >> file` to append to a file.

### Editing Files
- Use `vi` or Vim (see `vim.md` in the same folder for commands).

### Moving and Copying
- `mv source destination` to move or rename files/directories.
- `cp source destination` to copy files/directories. Use `-r` for recursive copy.

### Removing Files
- `rm filename` to remove a file.

## File Permissions (`chmod`)
- `-rw-r--r--` example permissions showing read/write for the user, read for group and others.
- `chmod u+x file` to add execute permission for the user.
- `chmod 755 file` to set read/write/execute for the user, and read/execute for group and others.

## Miscellaneous Commands

### `echo`
- `echo "message"` to display a message.

### Viewing File Contents
- `head file` to view the first 10 lines of a file.
- `tail file` to view the last 10 lines of a file.
- `head -n 20 file` or `tail -n 20 file` to view a custom number of lines from the beginning or end of a file.

### Combining Commands with Pipe (`|`)
- `command1 | command2` to pass the output of `command1` as input to `command2`.

### `grep`
- `grep "pattern" file` to search for a pattern in a file.
- Various flags can modify the search behavior (e.g., `-i` for case-insensitive search).

### Running Scripts
- `bash script_name.sh` to execute a shell script.

## Recommended Additions
- **`find`**: For searching files and directories based on criteria like name, size, and modification date.
- **`curl`**: For making requests to web servers, useful for downloading files or testing APIs.

This README serves as a quick reference to some of the most commonly used terminal commands and concepts covered in Week 2 of our advanced Bash and terminal classes.
